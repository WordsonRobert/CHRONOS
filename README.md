# How We Came Up With It (with Guatam)
Computational Heuristics for Rational Optimisation of Neurotherapeutic Operating Systems. This was the first "big" independent project I had undertaken. This started with us simply talking after Gautam had come back from PARIS for their igem conference. He was going on and on about how it was not worth it. Amidst all the talk, we came up with the base of this idea. It was initially "CURING ALZHEIMERS" but later it became delaying the onset of alzheimers via early detection. We decided to work on igem again together the same night. We worked hard for the next 3 months, with valuable input from Savith. Gautam took the mentoring role and I learnt so much new things to try and implement or validate the structures and reactions. I am super proud of our work on this.
